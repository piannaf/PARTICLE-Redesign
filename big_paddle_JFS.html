                    focus of the summer of 2005 was on getting the &#8220;Big 
                    Paddles&#8221; up and running. On route to their permanent 
                    home at FermiLab as part of <a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www-e815.fnal.gov/">NuTev</a> 
                    , these large .8 by 3.5 meter scintillating panels took a 
                    detour to the University of Rochester where they were fitted 
                    out for operation. </p>
                  <p>The first step was to test PMTs (<a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/summer%20presentations/student%20posters/PMT%20TESTING%20POSTER.pdf">pdf</a>) 
                    and decide which ones to attach to the panels. Then, each 
                    PMT needed to be attached to the panels in such a way that 
                    the loss of light from the panel to the PMT was minimized, 
                    which the students accomplished by making silicon cookies. 
                    Each PMT also needed to be outfitted with high voltage bases. 
                    Once all these parts were attached, the panels underwent light 
                    leak testing, gamma testing, and efficiency testing. The results 
                    from each restored panel (<a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/summer%20presentations/student%20posters/PANEL%20RESTORATION%20POSTER.pdf">pdf</a>) 
                    were carefully mapped out.</p>
                  <p><img src="big_paddle_JFS_files/image004.jpg" width="315" height="236" align="right">Students 
                    also worked on other projects (<a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/summer%20presentations/student%20posters/Greg%27s%20Investigations%20Poster.pdf">pdf</a>). 
                    One student explored the relationship between pressure and 
                    muon rates. Two more students analyzed data from the MOLAR 
                    Detector. These students also pressure calibrated many of 
                    the DAQ boards used in classroom set-ups by the PARTICLE program. 
                    Now, the boards can be used during the year to accurately 
                    measure atmospheric pressure.</p>
                  <p>Several students working with Mr. Paul Conrow tried to develop 
                    an aqueous scintillator (<a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/summer%20presentations/student%20posters/Conrow_poster_2005.pdf">pdf</a>)that 
                    is sensitive to gamma rays.</p>
                  <p>Finally, before the Big Paddles were gone forever, and just 
                    before the summer ended, the students explored the nature 
                    of muon showers (<a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/summer%20presentations/student%20posters/MUON%20SHOWER%20POSTER.pdf">pdf</a>) 
                    (wavefronts of muons that originated from the same collision 
                    of a highly energetic cosmic ray and a molecule in the upper 
                    atmosphere.) They arranged several of the large paddles into 
                    an array looking for events when all the paddles were triggered 
                    within a few nanoseconds of each other. Then, by analyzing 
                    the timing of the events, the students could conclude which 
                    events were actual wavefronts and which were simply unrelated 
                    particles, and then could investigate the orientations of 
                    these muon showers. Both a brief summary (<a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/big%20paddle%20work/summer%202005/Muon%20Shower%20Summary%20&amp;%20Data/An%20Investigation%20of%20Muons%20in%20Atmospheric%20Air%20Showers.doc">doc</a>)
