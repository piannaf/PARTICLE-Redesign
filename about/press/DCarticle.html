(August 10, 2000) -- Twelve area physics teachers have headed back to the classroom a few weeks early, but not to teach. They're in class as students.<p>
  For the past week and a half, the teachers -- from Rochester, Pittsford, Naples, Ontario County, and Geneseo, Livingston County -- have been attending the Quarknet program at the University of Rochester to learn about the latest trends in modern physics.  This is the program's first year. <p>
  The teachers will take what they have learned back to their classrooms to share with their physics students.<p>
  Margaret Kretow, a teacher at the School of the Arts, said she is having fun being a student.<p>
  "I'm learning a heck of a lot. I'm so used to teaching classical physics. I'm getting really enlightened," she said.<p>
  Classes began July 31 and will end Tuesday, but the teachers will continue to meet during the school year for follow-up discussions about how they incorporated new learning into their curriculum. They also want to assess what worked and what didn't work.<p>
   Kevin McFarland, a physics professor at the University of Rochester who is co-chair of the program, said the use of modern research is lacking in high school physics classes. <p>
  "This will give them something related to on-going research to bring back to their classroom," McFarland said.<p>
    The teachers built their own cosmic ray telescopes from raw materials to learn about the physics involved, and analyzed the information they collected.<p>
   One pair of teachers studied the effect of lead on cosmic rays, another worked to see whether a magnetic force would bend the rays. <p>
   A computer attached to the detectors is used to compile the data.<p>
   Once the course is completed, the detectors become part of an equipment lending library in the physics and astronomy department, so any teacher can borrow a detector for weeks at a time and demonstrate it to his or her class.<p>
   John D'Onofrio, a physics teacher at Geneseo Central High School, said he is excited about getting a taste of what he calls "big physics."<p>
   "In the high school class, you got little stuff to play with. Now we have equipment that we can borrow to show our students how it works."<p>
