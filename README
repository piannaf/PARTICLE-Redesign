PARTICLE redesign

---------------------

I was tasked by Professor McFarland at the Unversity of Rochester to redesign
the PARTICLE (Physicists And Rochester Teachers Inventing CLassroom Experiments)
Summer Program website.

This is a mirror of the site as of November 2009 containing only the parts that
I had redesigned. The original files, from 2004, have been lost but from looking
at the source, all HTML, CSS, JavaScript and directory structure seem to be the
same as when I wrote it up.

I assume that since I was under the employ of The University of Rochester, the
copyright belongs to them. If it is discovered that I do not have permission to
have this on GitHub, I will take it down.

The current address for the PARTICLE website is at:
