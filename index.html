                    area high school classrooms since 1999, is designed to fulfill 
                    two main goals:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>To promote open-ended, inquiry-based experiments and student

                    Program Components<a name="_Program_Components"></a></h2>
                  <p>The PARTICLE Program has essentially three parts to it:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="summer_institute.html">Summer Institute</a> &#8211; 
                      This is a three week course during the summer at the University 
                      of Rochester for both new and returning teachers. 
                      <ul>
                        <li>New teachers will build the cosmic ray detectors they 
                          will use in their classrooms and perform experiments 
                          with their detectors. Plenty of time is dedicated to 
                          working the laboratory so that new teachers will become 
                          comfortable with the entire experimental process that 
                          their students will go through: thinking of a question, 
                          designing an experiment to answer their question, collecting 
                          the necessary data, analyzing their data, and evaluating 
                          their results. New teachers will also attend lectures 
                          on topics in particle physics, such as the standard 
                          model, so they can bring that knowledge back to their 
                          classroom. There are opportunities for the new teachers 
                          to discuss pedagogy and talk about how to integrate 
                          the detectors into their classrooms. Returning teachers 
                          often participate in these discussions.</li>
                        <li>The Summer Institute is also a time for returning 
                          teachers to &quot;come back&quot; to the U of R. Returning 
                          teachers are encouraged either to work on developing 
                          resources for their classrooms or to bring their students 
                          to campus for a few weeks and do more extensive research 
                          with them.</li>
                      </ul>

                      &#8211; Cosmic ray detectors are available for use in the 
                      classroom during the school year. Teachers have integrated 
                      the detectors into their classrooms in different ways. For 
                      example, some teachers have used the detectors as part of 
                      an in-class lab during their modern physics unit while other 
                      teachers have encouraged their students to design and conduct 
                      a long-term research project outside of class. Throughout 
                      the school year, U of R physicists make themselves available 
                      as a resource for teachers. U of R physicists visit classrooms 
                      to give lectures on requested topics, to bring modern physics 
                      demonstrations, to assist students with their projects, 
                      and to provide technical support.</li>

                      a one-day poster conference at the end of the school year 
                      where students have the opportunity to share their research 
                      with their peers. In addition to learning what projects 
                      other students have been working on, students are taken 
                      on a tour of the physics labs at the University of Rochester.</li>

                  <p>The PARTICLE Program addresses the following components of 
                    the New York State curriculum:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Lab Time &#8211; Experiments with cosmic ray detectors 
                      can help satisfy laboratory time requirements. The Physics, 
                      Chemistry, and Earth Science Regents curricula stipulate 
                      that 1200 minutes must be spent doing laboratory activities; 
                      students are also required to demonstrate laboratory skills 
                      to pass the course. The College Board recommends 2400 minutes 
                      of lab time before the AP exams.</li>
                    <li>Experimental Methods - Experiments with cosmic ray detectors 
                      designed and conducted by students meet science process 
                      skills outlined in Standards 1, 2, and 7 of the New York 
                      State curriculum.</li>
                    <li>Modern Physics Content &#8211; The New York State Regents 
                      Exam in Physics requires the following topics in modern 
                      physics to be covered in the course: 
                      <ul>
                        <li>States of matter and energy are restricted to discrete 
                          values (quantized) (V.1, 5.3a).</li>
                        <li>Charge is quantized on two levels. On the atomic level, 
                          charge is restricted to the elementary charge. On the 
                          sub-nuclear level charge appears as fractional values 
                          of the elementary charge (quarks) (V.2, 5.3b).</li>
                        <li>On the atomic level, energy is emitted or absorbed 
                          in discrete packets called photons (V.3, 5.3c)</li>
                        <li>The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency 
                          (V.4, 5.3d).</li>
                        <li>On the atomic level, energy and matter exhibit the 
                          characteristics of both waves and particles (V.5, 5.3e).</li>
                        <li>Among other things, mass-energy and charge are conserved 
                          at all levels (from subnuclear to cosmic) (V.6, 5.3f).</li>
                        <li>The Standard Model of Particle Physics has evolved 
                          from previous attempts to explain the nature of the 
                          atom and states that: 
                          <ul>
                            <li>Atomic particles are composed of sub-nuclear particles.</li>
                            <li>The nucleus is a conglomeration of quarks which 
                              manifest themselves as protons and neutrons.</li>
                            <li>Each elementary particle has a corresponding antiparticle 
                              (V.7, 5.3g).</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Behaviors and characteristics of matter, from the 
                          microscopic to the cosmic levels, are manifestations 
                          of its atomic structure. The macroscopic characteristics 
                          of matter, such as electrical and optical properties, 
                          are the result of microscopic interactions (V.8, 5.3h).</li>
                        <li>The total of the fundamental interactions is responsible 
                          for the appearance and behavior of the objects in the 
                          universe (V.9, 5.3i).</li>
                        <li>The fundamental source of all energy in the universe 
                          is the conversion of mass into energy (V.10, 5.3j) [20].</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>While the AP Physics C course does not require modern 
                        physics topics, the AP Physics B course requires that 
                        the following topics in modern physics to be covered in
