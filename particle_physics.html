                    physics is the study of the fundamental particles of the universe, 
                    or, in other words, particle physics is the study of really, 
                    really small stuff. As of right now, we know of 12 fundamental 
                    particles: six quarks and six leptons. (See the particle periodic 
                    table to the right.) This is known as the Standard Model in 
                    the physics world. There are currently hundreds of identified 
                    particles made from combinations of these twelve fundamental 
                    particles and scientists are still finding more.</p>

                    What are quarks?<a name=quarks id=quarks></a></h2>
                  <p>Quarks are the fundamental building blocks of nature. They 
                    combine to form larger particles, such as protons and neutrons. 
                    There are six different types of quarks: up, down, charm, 
                    strange, top, and bottom. If you look at the table above, 
                    the mass of the particle increases as you go to the right, 
                    meaning the top quark is much heavier than the up quark. Quarks 
                    in the top row have a charge of +2/3 of an electron's charge 
                    (where e = 1.9 x 10-19 C) and quarks in the second row have 
                    a charge of -1/3 of an electron's charge. You may think this 
                    is strange because you were taught that you can't have a fraction 
                    of the charge on an electron. Your instinct is correct: because 
                    of this fractional charge, quarks can not exist independently; 
                    they must combine to form larger particles.</p>

                  <p>Quarks combine to form most of the matter in the universe. 
                    In fact, most of the matter in the universe is made from just 
                    two quarks: the up and the down. For example, a neutron is 
                    made of two down quarks and one up quark (add the charges, 
                    it makes sense! -1/3e + -1/3e + 2/3e = 0) and a proton is 
                    made of two up quarks and a down quarks (+2/3e + 2/3e -1/3e 
                    = 1e). In general, you need three quarks to make a particle, 
                    so that the charge always adds up to a whole number.</p>

                  <p>Leptons are the six particles at the bottom of the periodic 
                    table. The bottom row shows the electron, the muon, and the 
                    tau particles. You are probably familiar with the electron; 
                    the muon and the tau are the heavier, less well known cousins 
                    to the electron. The muon and tau are rarer than the electron, 
                    have the same negative charge that the electron has. We'll 
                    talk more about muons below. The top row shows the neutrinos. 
                    There is one neutrino for each of the electron, the muon, 
                    and the tau. Leptons are much lighter than the quarks, in 
                    fact the neutrinos are so light that there is debate whether 
                    they have mass at all!</p>

                    not just science fiction! There actually is something known 
                    as anti-matter is real physics. Every particle we talked about 
                    above, both quarks and leptons, has an anti-particle. The 
                    anti-particle is exactly the same as the particle (i.e. same 
                    mass) but all the properties are opposite. For example, an 
                    up quark has a charge of +2/3, so an anti-up quark would have 
                    a charge of -2/3.</p>
                  <p>The anti-matter quarks can interact and form new particles 
                    in the same way the quarks do. The difference is that now 
                    you need a quark and an anti-quark to make a particle, instead 
                    of the three quarks like we stated above.</p>

                  <p><img src="particle_physics_files/cosmic_rays.jpg" width="274" height="418" hspace="10" align="left">Most 
                    muons come from what are known as cosmic rays. What are cosmic 
                    rays? Cosmic rays are caused by high energy protons from stars 
                    in outer space that interact with the Earth's atmosphere. 
                    Scientists are unsure of the origin of the highest energy 
                    cosmic rays. As they fall toward the earth, they ionize the 
                    atmosphere forming a shower of matter and anti-matter particles. 
                    These particles are known as pions (p) and are made up of 
                    up and down quarks and anti-quarks. You may have never heard 
                    of a pion before and that is because they don't last very 
                    long. They quickly decay into lighter things, such as leptons 
                    and electromagnetic radiation. This is where our muons come 
                    from: they are the results of an interaction between a proton 
                    and the atmosphere that produces a particle that decays into 
                    a muon, among other things. Other leptons, such as electrons 
                    and neutrinos are also emitted, but the muons have a higher 
                    energy so are more likely to make it down to the Earth's surface. 
                    These showers are happening all the time. About 600 particles 
                    pass through your body each minute!</p>
                  <p>The picture to the left illustrates a cosmic ray shower. 
                    The yellow streak is the proton, the red and purple streaks 
                    are pions and the others are leptons. The white squiggly lines 
                    are electromagnetic radiation, such as photons. In the picture, 
                    you may notice that the muon (&micro;+) and some of the electrons 
                    (e-, e+) have positive charges. We said about that the muons 
                    and electrons were negatively charged, so the positive charge 
                    indicated that it is the anti-particle. As far as decays are 
                    concerned, the anti-particle behaves the same way as the particle 
                    would.</p>

                    Why study muons?<a name=study></a></h2>
                  <p>The simple answer is that we study muons because we can. 
                    Muons from cosmic rays are relatively easy to detect. The 
                    telescopes are portable and can be used in the classroom for 
                    a variety of experiments. By studying the cosmic rays, we 
                    can find how the rate that muons are detected depends on the 
                    weather, direction, or extra-terrestrial events, such as solar 
                    flares. The question to answer in your research project is: 
                    why do these factors affect the muon rate?</p>

                    How can we detect cosmic rays?<a
      name=detect></a></h2>
                  <p>Cosmic rays, and muons in particular, are hard to detect 
                    because they are traveling very fast and pass through most 
                    materials without interacting. The trick to detecting them 
                    is to take advantage of the fact that they are charged particles. 
                    When a charged particle passes through a particular substance 
                    it can ionize the surrounding particles and leave a trail. 
                    For example, in a cloud chamber, the air is cooled to the 
                    point that when an atmospheric particle is ionized, it will 
                    cause the air to condense and thus leaves a visible trail. 
                    With the cloud chamber, you can see both muons and electrons, 
                    but to the untrained eye, it is hard to tell the difference.</p>
